1
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,963
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

2
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:10,463
That you were very upset

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:12,398
and that I should
take it easy on you.

4
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,951
I didn't tell her that.

5
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:16,388
Maybe you need a little break.

6
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:19,293
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

7
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:20,509
She shouldn't have said anything.

8
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,668
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

9
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:23,452
I didn't.

10
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,296
You could be brilliant.

11
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,234
But you're a coward.

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,571
Sorry.

13
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:35,068
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,620
Stop being so fucking weak.

15
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,050
Again!

16
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:51,906
Lily...

17
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:55,020
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:55,983
I need to talk to you.

19
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:56,931
Okay.

20
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,425
Now.

21
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,291
Shut up.

22
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,542
Come on.

23
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:06,120
What's up?

24
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,767
You told Thomas about last night?

25
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,356
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

26
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,481
Why would he talk to you?

27
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:17,176
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

28
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:21,066
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

29
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,000
Well you shouldn't have.

30
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:26,872
Okay.

31
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,300
Has he tried anything with you?

32
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,480
He has a reputation.

33
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,646
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

34
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,805
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,245
He's not.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,895
Good.

37
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,548
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

38
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:28,674
Thanks.

39
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:30,881
Not like that.

40
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:34,244
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,183
What career?

42
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,893
The one I gave up to have you.

43
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,247
I'm twenty-eight.

44
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:45,673
So?

45
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,537
Only that...

46
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:50,596
Only what?

47
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,260
Nothing.

48
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,529
- What?
- Nothing.

49
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,254
How is your skin?

50
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,367
Fine.

51
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,048
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Let me see.

53
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,335
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

54
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,027
Can I help you?

55
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,387
Who was that?

56
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:32,971
It was no one.

57
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:35,752
It was no one.

58
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:41,563
Hello?

59
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,081
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,069
I just came by to apologize.

61
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,303
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

62
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:53,513
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

63
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:55,208
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

64
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,772
Oh, she's a trip.

65
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,174
How do you know where I live?

66
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,704
I have my ways.

67
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:07,122
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

68
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:11,697
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

69
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,975
So how about I take you out to dinner?

70
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,504
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's fine.

71
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,759
What about drinks?

72
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,434
Sweetie, you need to rest.

73
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,667
- Jesus.
- Wait.

74
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:26,344
What are you doing?

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,517
I'm going out.

76
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:30,091
What?
Nina!

77
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:32,795
You're on the stage tomorrow.

78
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,019
I can't believe he calls her that.

79
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:38,640
- It's so gross.
- I think it's sweet.

80
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,494
Little Princess?

81
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,968
- He probably calls every girl that.
- No way.

82
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,985
That's just for Beth.

83
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,631
Well, I bet he'll be calling you
Little Princess any day now.

84
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,181
I don't know about that.

85
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:54,446
Oh, sure he will.
Just got to let him lick your pussy.

86
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,247
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

87
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:00,089
<i>Mmm, dankeschön.</i>

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,384
Let me know
if that's juicy enough for you.

89
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,227
Oh, I will.

90
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,982
You have enough cheese?

91
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,395
No, but you do.

92
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:14,787
Enjoy.

93
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:25,331
All right.

94
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,531
Wanna spruce up?

95
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,671
What, I carry a spare

96
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:39,935
in case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

97
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:45,352
So how is he?

98
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:49,126
Thomas.

99
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,118
I wouldn't know.

100
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:55,537
- Oh, come on.
- I really don't want to talk about that.

101
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,429
Okay.

102
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:03,187
You really need to relax.

103
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:11,667
One for you,

104
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,664
one for me.

105
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:18,874
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise.
I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

106
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,272
What is it?

107
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,361
Are you kidding?

108
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,596
You've never rolled?

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,181
Oh, relax. Here.
It'll loosen you up.

110
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:37,174
Wait till you see the night sky.

111
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:42,356
How long does it last?

112
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,878
A couple hours, tops.

113
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:51,127
It's okay.

114
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,789
Okay.

115
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,256
Nina, hi!

116
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:03,811
I thought we could use some company.
So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

117
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:07,508
- Actually it's Andrew.
- Tom.

118
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:11,206
- I have to go...
- Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

119
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,529
I shouldn't...

120
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,344
We're on the stage tomorrow.

121
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,470
So what are you going to do?
Go home to Mommy?

122
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:22,841
Come on, live a little.

123
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,901
It's just a couple hours, right?

124
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,345
Tops.

125
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:36,282
Cheers.

126
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,869
You haven't told me who you are.

127
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,253
I'm a dancer.

128
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,834
No, I mean your name.

129
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,847
- Oh. Nina.
- So are you two sisters?

130
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:47,798
- Yes.
- No.

131
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:52,141
- Blood sisters.
- We dance in the same company.

132
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:55,887
Ah, ballerinas.
No wonder you two look alike.

133
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,879
I see now.
Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

134
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,869
- Very funny.
- I like to amuse myself.

135
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:02,352
I've never been to the ballet.

136
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:05,296
Then you are definitely not gay.

137
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,240
I mean, it's kind of boring,
isn't it?

138
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,392
- Be honest.
- No it's not.

139
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,429
You know what?
It's just not for everyone.

140
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,342
You should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

141
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,786
Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,334
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
- Okay well...

143
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,319
I think it's time for another round.

144
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,816
Bottoms up.

145
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,813
So what are you guys
working on now?

146
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,942
Sorry.

147
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,771
<i>Swan Lake.</i>

148
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,068
Yeah?

149
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:40,755
You know it?

150
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:42,652
No, not really.

151
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:43,694
Heard of it.

152
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,124
What's it about?

153
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,723
It's about a girl who gets
turned into a swan,

154
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:51,329
and she needs love
to break the spell.

155
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:56,016
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

156
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,053
and so she kills herself.

157
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:03,290
It's not a happy ending then.

158
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:06,461
It's beautiful, actually.

159
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:10,708
Like you.

160
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,791
Huh?

161
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:15,052
I said you're beautiful.

162
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:19,872
That's funny?

163
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,182
Looks like someone might be rolling.

164
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:35,496
All right, come on.
Come on, it's time to go dance.

165
00:10:58,143 --> 00:10:58,951
Nina!

166
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:38,059
Hey, what the fuck?
Where you going?

167
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:01,645
Nina!

168
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,920
Where are you going?

169
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,962
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

170
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,854
Late?

171
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,906
Where have you been?

172
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,888
To the moon and back.

173
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:43,327
- You've been drinking.
- Ding ding ding ding ding!

174
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,065
- What else?
- Hmm?

175
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,625
What else have you been doing?

176
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,231
Oh, you want to know their names?

177
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:57,118
- You need to sleep this off.
- There were two. Tom and Jerry.

178
00:13:57,141 --> 00:13:59,560
- Be quiet, Nina.
- And I fucked them both.

179
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,649
Shut your mouth!

180
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,777
- Don't come in here.
- What's this?

181
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:19,182
It's called privacy.
I'm not twelve anymore.

182
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,764
- You're not my Nina right now...
- Leave me alone!

183
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,227
Sweat girl.

184
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:19,638
Why didn't you wake me up?

185
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:23,382
I'm moving out.

186
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,874
My music!

187
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,164
Thomas, I am so sorry.

188
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,078
Keep on going.

189
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:52,725
Go get warmed up.

190
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:35,953
That was good.

191
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:39,442
Actually, really good.

192
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,649
Okay, let's take ten.

193
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,236
Look, he just wanted to mark it
and asked me to step up, okay?

194
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,370
I overslept.

195
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:58,071
Oops. But hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

196
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,746
You put something in my drink.

197
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,576
Yeah.

198
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,278
And then you just
took off in the morning.

199
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,458
In the morning?

200
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,427
Yeah, you slept over.

201
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:10,850
Um, no.

202
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:15,243
Unless your name's Tom
and you had a dick.

203
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:18,869
What, Nina?

204
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,921
Did you have some sort of
lesbian wet dream about me?

205
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:30,358
- Stop.
- Oh my God!

206
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:33,698
Oh my God, you did!
You fantasized about me!

207
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,145
- Shut up!
- Was I good?

208
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,566
The final act.

209
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,556
You're trying to dance.

210
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:29,184
You've tasted your dream!
Touched it!

211
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,542
Only to have it crushed!

212
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,630
Your heart is broken,

213
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,990
wounded.
Your life force fading.

214
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:45,706
The blood drips.

215
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,962
The Black Swan stole your love.
There is only one way to end the pain.

216
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,596
You are not fearful,
but filled with acceptance.

217
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:02,857
And you look down at Rothbart,

218
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:03,977
and then at the Prince,

219
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,093
and then, yes,
at the audience.

220
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,218
And then you jump.

221
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,870
Go ahead. Jump.
Jump!

222
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,235
Okay, everybody get a drink of water,
then it's notes.

223
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:45,630
You lost weight.

224
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,272
Take off your shrug, please.

225
00:22:59,011 --> 00:22:59,768
Very good.

226
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,023
Face front.
We're almost done.

227
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,302
And that's it.
Okay.

228
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:16,433
We're done.
Thank you very much.

229
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,841
Georgina, I'm Lily.
Thomas sent me...

230
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:24,681
Yes, we have to get you measured
for the Swan Queen costumes.

231
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:25,842
What's she doing here?

232
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,402
He made me your alternate.

233
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,554
Look, it's just in case.

234
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:37,673
Thomas.
Thomas.

235
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:38,804
- Thomas.
- Yes?

236
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,957
It can't be her.

237
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,855
It can't be her.

238
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,368
Okay, why don't you just go.
I'll catch up later.

239
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:46,152
What's going on?

240
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:49,219
Lily...
You made her my alternate?

241
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,516
There's always an alternate.
Lily is the best choice.

242
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:54,950
No, she wants my role.

243
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,323
Every dancer in the world
wants your role.

244
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,852
No, this is different.
She is after me.

245
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:03,304
- She is trying to replace me.
- Nobody is after you.

246
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,181
- No, please believe me...

247
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:14,051
I know it's been a struggle.
But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

248
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,452
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance
and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

249
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,084
Now go home and rest.

250
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,804
From the vision again.

251
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:58,930
What happened?

252
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,024
I've got a life.don't work too hard.
It's a big day tomorrow.

253
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:51,099
I'm still working in here.

254
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:03,105
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

255
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:09,709
Hello?

256
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:59,100
What are you doing here?

257
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,042
I'm so sorry.

258
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:03,375
I'm so sorry.

259
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,985
I know how it feels now.
She's trying to replace me.

260
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,603
What do I do?

261
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:15,039
You stole my things?

262
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,713
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

263
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:21,308
Perfect?

264
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:28,448
I'm not perfect.

265
00:28:31,037 --> 00:28:31,956
I'm nothing.

266
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:37,513
Nothing!

267
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,720
Nothing, nothing!

268
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,646
Sweet girl.

269
00:29:57,073 --> 00:29:57,550
Mommy?

270
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:03,973
Sweet girl.
Sweet girl.

271
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:10,124
Stop!

272
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:19,788
What are you doing?

273
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,193
Sweetie?

274
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:31,669
Nina?

275
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,456
Nina!

276
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:34,756
Go away!

277
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,207
Open the door!

278
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,439
Go away!

279
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,019
Open the door, Nina!

280
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:51,153
Nina!

281
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:04,461
Get out!

282
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,738
- What's wrong with you?
- Get out!

283
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,777
- Get out!
- What do you see?

284
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:10,483
Get out!

285
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:50,385
It's okay.

286
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:52,489
I'm here.

287
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,975
You were scratching all night.

288
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,276
Where's my clock?

289
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,599
- Don't worry about that.
- What time is it?

290
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,880
- The show is tonight, I have to...
- No, no, no, no.

291
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,177
Don't worry.

292
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:11,193
I called the theater and I told them
you aren't feeling well.

293
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,329
I have to go!

294
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:13,925
- No. No, you don't.
- Let go of me.

295
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,656
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

296
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:20,175
Where is it?

297
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,592
This role is destroying you.

298
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,882
- Move. Move!
- Nina...!

299
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,335
- What happened to my sweet girl?
- She's gone!

300
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,343
Nina!
Oh, Nina!

301
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:35,089
No, please!

302
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,256
- You're not well!
- Let go of me!

303
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,960
You can't handle this.

304
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:40,825
I can't?

305
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,905
I'm the Swan Queen.
You're the one who never left the corps.

306
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:46,236
Nina!

307
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:03,496
What are you doing here?

308
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,762
Nina?

309
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:06,705
She was supposed to be sick.

310
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,190
Give us a minute.

311
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:14,134
Are you okay?

312
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,801
I'm fine.

313
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:21,077
Nina.

314
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:24,109
Nina.

315
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:25,511
What?

316
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,228
I've already asked Lily.

317
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:30,207
Have you announced it?

318
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,287
After Beth, do you really need
another controversy?

319
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:42,355
I'm here, Thomas.

320
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,864
I'm doing it.

321
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:52,460
The only person
standing in your way is you.

322
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:57,148
It's time to let it go.
Lose yourself.

323
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:13,895
White Swan, up in ten.

324
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:09,566
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

325
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,777
You suck.

326
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,797
Okay, Nina.

327
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:54,610
What the fuck?

328
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,687
- Are you okay?
- Nina, are you okay?

329
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:52,530
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

330
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,121
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
- This is a fucking disaster.

331
00:39:06,395 --> 00:39:09,903
Rough start, huh?
Must have been pretty humiliating.

332
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:12,980
Get out of my room.

333
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:15,433
I'm worried about the next act.

334
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:19,191
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

335
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,726
Stop.
Please stop.

336
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:26,010
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

337
00:39:28,297 --> 00:39:30,773
Leave me alone!

338
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:43,372
My turn!

339
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:44,992
My turn!

340
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:46,777
My turn!

341
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:55,583
It's my turn!

342
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,661
Black Swan, places in five.

343
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,370
Come on.

344
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,884
Good job.
Fifteen to the last act.

345
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,724
Hey.
You were amazing.

346
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:43,482
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us,

347
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,917
but I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

348
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:51,554
Okay, well I guess that's it.

349
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,327
So I'll let you finish.
Bye.

350
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,066
Can you hear them?

351
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,006
They love you!

352
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,733
My little princess,
I always knew you had it in you.

353
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:28,385
Come on.
Let's take you out.

354
00:48:34,608 --> 00:48:35,361
Go get some help.

355
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:36,360
Go get some help!

356
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:37,827
What did you do?

357
00:48:37,862 --> 00:48:38,983
What did you do?

358
00:48:39,018 --> 00:48:43,172
- I felt it.
- What?

359
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:45,487
I felt perfect.

360
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,502
I was perfect.

361
00:49:03,782 --> 00:49:06,216
Nina! Nina! Nina!
