1
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,236
I had the craziest dream last night.

2
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,586
I was dancing the White Swan.

3
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:06,552
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

4
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,193
It was the prologue,

5
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,015
when Rothbart casts his spell.

6
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,442
Look how pink. So pretty...

7
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,241
Pretty!

8
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:34,303
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

9
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:36,516
Well, he certainly should.

10
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,445
You've been there long enough,

11
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,330
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

12
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:46,697
Up.

13
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,568
- What's that?
- What?

14
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:50,767
There.

15
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,213
Nothing.

16
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,135
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

17
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,328
You're a sweet girl.

18
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,593
Did you see Beth today?

19
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,867
I can't believe she's back.

20
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:26,250
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

21
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,488
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

22
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,175
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

23
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,594
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

24
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,545
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

25
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,247
No, someone new.

26
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:44,418
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

27
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,886
It's sad.

28
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,555
What's sad?

29
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,789
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

30
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,360
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

31
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,903
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

32
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:07,331
Great.

33
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,858
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

34
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,313
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

35
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,620
Beautiful as always, Nina.

36
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:07,887
Relax.

37
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,504
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

38
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,030
Stop, John.
One second.

39
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,819
Okay, take position.

40
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:40,805
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

41
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,264
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

42
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,571
Hello, dear.

43
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,247
We all know the story.

44
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:09,992
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

45
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,662
trapped in the body of a swan.

46
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:16,170
She desires freedom

47
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,145
that only true love can break the spell.

48
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:27,488
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

49
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:31,692
But before he can declare his love,

50
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:37,809
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

51
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:47,690
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

52
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:52,654
killing herself.
And in death...

53
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:55,481
finds freedom.

54
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,069
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

55
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:08,357
We will open our season
with Swan Lake.

56
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:10,586
Done to death, I know.

57
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,186
But not like this.

58
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:17,086
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

59
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,977
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

60
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,726
A fresh face to present to the world.

61
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:32,963
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

62
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,331
The White, and the Black.

63
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,353
All the soloists I tapped:

64
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:48,459
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

65
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,074
And the girls I didn't tap:

66
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,384
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

67
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,860
Thank you.

68
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,151
All right.

69
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,856
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

70
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,974
Fuck! Fuck!

71
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:51,680
What?

72
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,402
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

73
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,424
But I'm not.

74
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,200
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

75
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:42,977
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

76
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,609
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

77
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:12,914
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

78
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,105
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

79
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,598
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

80
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:30,704
Well...

81
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,031
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

82
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,916
Girls, this is Lily.

83
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:38,525
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

84
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,218
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

85
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,102
No, it's okay.

86
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:42,309
I'm good.

87
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:45,671
Should I go again?

88
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,592
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

89
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,189
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

90
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,078
Come on, come on, come on, please.

91
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:02,006
All right, Maestro.

92
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,740
Two, three...

93
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:12,003
So how'd it go?

94
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:15,998
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

95
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:19,178
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

96
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,386
So?

97
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,213
It was fine.

98
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,195
Just fine?

99
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,837
Oh, sweetheart...

100
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:32,671
You tell me about it.

101
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,126
Nina, everything all right?

102
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,167
I'm fine.

103
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:44,790
Almost done.

104
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,999
You're working yourself too hard.

105
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,604
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

106
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,477
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

107
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:02,724
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

108
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,233
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

109
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:06,694
You don't need to lie.

110
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,464
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

111
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,348
Oh, sweetheart.

112
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,048
I know it's disappointing.

113
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,726
When you start getting older,
there's all this

114
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,493
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

115
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,610
But it's all right.

116
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:31,533
No matter what.

117
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,241
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

118
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,623
That's such a wonderful part.

119
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:42,368
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

120
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:46,338
Either way, you'll shine.

121
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:49,008
You know...

122
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:51,823
Everything will be better
in the morning.

123
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,117
It always is.

124
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:00,528
Sweet girl.

125
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:27,492
Yes, Nina?

126
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:28,807
Do you have a minute?

127
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,809
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

128
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:38,741
So...

129
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,740
I just wanted to tell you that

130
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:46,665
I practiced the coda last night and

131
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,548
I finished.

132
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,876
I thought you should know.

133
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:58,721
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

134
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:01,709
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

135
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:02,879
No.
Anyway...

136
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:05,327
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

137
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:08,096
Sorry.

138
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,178
Okay, thank you.

139
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,083
That's it?

140
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:16,606
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

141
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,008
You must have thought
it was possible.

142
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:23,302
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

143
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,502
I came to ask for the part.

144
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:32,972
Well...

145
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,939
The truth is...

146
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:39,876
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

147
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:44,115
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

148
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:45,935
Ideal casting.

149
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,294
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

150
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,988
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

151
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,126
Really?

152
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:58,217
In four years,
every time you dance,

153
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:03,102
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

154
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:07,224
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

155
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,661
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

156
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,479
I want to be perfect.

157
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,631
Perfection is not just about control.

158
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:24,256
It's also about letting go.

159
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:28,921
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

160
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,170
And very few have it in them.

161
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,786
I think I do have it in me.

162
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:42,624
You bit me?

163
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,728
I can't believe you bit me!

164
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,334
I'm sorry.

165
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,545
Man, that fucking hurt!

166
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:07,161
What?

167
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,370
Why's she always staring at me?

168
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,731
Hey, it's been posted.

169
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,327
Hey, it's up!

170
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,079
Veronica.

171
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:26,118
Congratulations.

172
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:42,589
Hey!

173
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:44,821
Why would you say that?

174
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,028
Your idea of some sick joke?

175
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:49,428
What?

176
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:51,895
Fuck you.

177
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:06,865
Hey, Nina!

178
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,333
Congratulations!

179
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,107
Congratulations.

180
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:17,571
You're so beautiful.

181
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:20,557
Congratulations.

182
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,110
- Hello?
- Hi.

183
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:41,088
What is it?
What's wrong?

184
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,694
I'm fine.

185
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,237
He picked me, Mom.

186
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:50,570
Do you hear me?

187
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,458
- For Swan Lake?
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!

188
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:56,919
Mom!

189
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,386
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

190
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:01,490
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

191
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:37,358
Mom?

192
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,096
Mom, are you in your room?

193
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:16,733
Nina?

194
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:18,204
Are you home?

195
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:32,498
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

196
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:35,942
Come on, sweetie.

197
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,674
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

198
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:50,651
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

199
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,245
Oh, Mom, not too big.

200
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,220
Oh, that's way, way too much.

201
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:56,342
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

202
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,842
My stomach's still in knots.

203
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:02,319
Fine.

204
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,180
Fine.

205
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,463
Then it's garbage!

206
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,715
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

207
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:19,189
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

208
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,959
It looks so yummy.

209
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,347
Okay, okay.

210
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:36,852
Thank you.
Thank you.

211
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,938
Thank you, Nina.

212
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,724
That's very nice.

213
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:42,907
Very nice.

214
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:47,716
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

215
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,446
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

216
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,222
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

217
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,532
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

218
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:21,858
Excellent.

219
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:27,884
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

220
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:33,542
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

221
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:36,242
A little bit more desperate.

222
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,019
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

223
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,317
That's it.

224
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:18,673
Watch the way she moves.

225
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:24,013
Imprecise,
but effortless.

226
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,518
She's not faking it.

227
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:36,641
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

228
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:38,521
Let's start again from the beginning.

229
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:50,441
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

230
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:51,810
Thanks, Susie.

231
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,264
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

232
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,244
They're beautiful.

233
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:15,551
I'll be back in a second.

234
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:19,907
Let me come back to you, please.

235
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,256
Let's go.

236
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:31,511
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

237
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:35,172
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

238
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:39,530
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

239
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:42,083
Good evening.

240
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:44,965
Let me make this
very important announcement.

241
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,230
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

242
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:54,030
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

243
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:56,064
of this true artist of our company.

244
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:59,086
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

245
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:02,904
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

246
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,926
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

247
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,053
You all know who I am talking about.

248
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:11,396
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

249
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:17,843
But as we all know,

250
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,257
every great career
has to come to an end.

251
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:25,146
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

252
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:29,485
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

253
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,043
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

254
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,099
My little princess,

255
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:39,403
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

256
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,495
and never forgotten.

257
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,594
But as we bid adieu to one star,
we welcome another.

258
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:50,616
We're opening our season
with my new version of Swan Lake.

259
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:55,624
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

260
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,001
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

261
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:11,495
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

262
00:32:13,872 --> 00:32:14,615
To beauty.

263
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,454
Just a second.

264
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:43,655
Just a second!

265
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:06,809
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

266
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,129
Hey, it's you!

267
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,740
I don't think we ever
officially met.

268
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:20,427
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

269
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:22,647
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

270
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:24,245
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:29,357
You must be so excited.

272
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,806
Are you freaking out?

273
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:33,878
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

274
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:36,952
Oh, it's okay.

275
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:38,819
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

276
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:41,078
I should get back...

277
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:42,817
No, no, no, come on, stay.

278
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,645
Keep me company.

279
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:49,143
Excuse me.

280
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:52,530
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

281
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,216
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

282
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:03,528
You did well.

283
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:04,932
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:07,021
Where are you going?

285
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,375
Upper west side.

286
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,183
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

287
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,982
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

288
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,424
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

289
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,459
Hello, Karen!

290
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:06,639
Beth!

291
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:10,570
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

292
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,431
What did you do to get this role?

293
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:20,466
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

294
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:24,616
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

295
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:28,777
Did you suck his cock?

296
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,543
Not all of us have to.

297
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:34,721
You fucking whore!

298
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:38,123
You're a fucking little whore!

299
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,569
Whoa, what's going on here?

300
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,734
Hey, I need to talk to you.

301
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,904
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

302
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:48,622
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

303
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:53,804
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

304
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,213
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

305
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:01,926
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

306
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:04,688
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

307
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,250
Don't worry. It's typical.

308
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:16,053
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

309
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:17,394
Drown this a little.

310
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:19,678
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

311
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:21,761
- No, me neither.
- Good.

312
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:26,163
So...
You got a boyfriend?

313
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,407
No.

314
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:32,289
Have you had many in the past?

315
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:34,360
A few.

316
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:36,045
But no one serious.

317
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:41,906
You're not a virgin are you?

318
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:46,110
No.

319
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:48,357
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

320
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,603
And you enjoy making love?

321
00:36:57,456 --> 00:36:57,957
Excuse me?

322
00:36:57,992 --> 00:37:00,145
Come on, sex.

323
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,577
Do you enjoy it?

324
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,434
We need to be able
to talk about this.

325
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,239
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

326
00:37:16,274 --> 00:37:20,731
Go home and touch yourself.

327
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:23,845
Live a little.

328
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,709
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

329
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:33,640
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

330
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:41,015
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

331
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,585
You know I asked.

332
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,393
I know you did.
Susie told me.

333
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,302
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

334
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:48,458
But why?

335
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:50,882
Don't blame him.

336
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,345
Where'd you get these?

337
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,204
They're fake.

338
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:00,026
Fooled me.

339
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,315
I can do it.

340
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:14,525
He must have been
by your side all night.

341
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,031
Showing you off.

342
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:22,021
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

343
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:24,219
Rash?
What are you talking about?

344
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,831
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

345
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:27,994
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

346
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:29,949
Mom!

347
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,425
This disgusting habit...

348
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,875
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

349
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,618
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

350
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:39,006
Sit down.
You have the white one,

351
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,066
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

352
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:45,805
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

353
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,279
No one will see it.

354
00:38:48,314 --> 00:38:49,921
Mom, please,

355
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:54,187
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

356
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:56,094
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

357
00:39:00,442 --> 00:39:00,868
You're all right.

358
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:04,238
You'll be all right.

359
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:09,510
Beth's in the hospital.

360
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,569
She had an accident.

361
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:14,273
Oh no!

362
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:14,747
Beth?

363
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:23,258
What happened?

364
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:27,597
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

365
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:30,846
You know what?

366
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:34,597
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

367
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,120
How do you know?

368
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:42,139
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

369
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,054
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

370
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,676
So dangerous.

371
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:52,108
Even perfect at times.

372
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:57,426
But also so damned destructive.

373
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,562
Was it right after we saw her?

374
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:05,476
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

375
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,622
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

376
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:11,849
This is your moment, Nina.

377
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:14,433
Don't let it go.

378
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:45,078
What are you doing?

379
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,569
Nina?

380
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,326
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

381
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:44,904
And...
Come on!

382
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:47,433
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

383
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:49,263
Come on.

384
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,302
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

385
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,601
Let it go.
Let it go.

386
00:45:57,636 --> 00:46:00,045
And again.

387
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,057
Feels like you have your diaphragm

388
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:05,809
is in a bit of a contraction?

389
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:06,967
I'm okay.

390
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:14,668
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

391
00:46:14,703 --> 00:46:16,768
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

392
00:46:16,803 --> 00:46:19,477
And exhale.

393
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,209
Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you plie?

394
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:27,015
Sometimes, not always.

395
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:31,967
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

396
00:46:37,873 --> 00:46:38,443
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

397
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,131
David,
can I ask you a question?

398
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,378
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

399
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:07,255
No.

400
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,817
No one would.

401
00:47:10,342 --> 00:47:11,003
Nina...

402
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:14,226
Your dancing is just as frigid...

403
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:16,644
Fuck!

404
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:23,607
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

405
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,056
The lights!

406
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:27,162
Thank you!

407
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:30,797
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

408
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:33,730
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

409
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:37,326
Have fun, you two.

410
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:41,690
Okay.

411
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,002
Come here.

412
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:44,044
Come, come, come, come.

413
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:48,075
I'll be the Prince.

414
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:10,169
Let it go. Let it go.

415
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:32,865
Feel my touch.

416
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,040
Respond to it.

417
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:35,328
Come on.

418
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:50,822
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

419
00:49:17,562 --> 00:49:18,769
That was me seducing you,

420
00:49:18,804 --> 00:49:21,495
when it needs to be
the other way around.

421
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,642
Please...

422
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:47,547
Who is that?

423
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:49,112
Hey.

424
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,570
You okay?

425
00:49:55,023 --> 00:49:56,241
You can't smoke in here.

426
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:59,863
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

427
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:04,241
So...

428
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:07,111
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

429
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:12,658
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

430
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:15,164
Thanks.

431
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:31,411
So...

432
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,053
Do  you want to talk about it?

433
00:50:36,607 --> 00:50:38,860
It's that hard to.

434
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,154
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

435
00:50:43,586 --> 00:50:44,896
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

436
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:46,960
He's brilliant.

437
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:50,379
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

438
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:53,321
What you don't know is...

439
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:58,444
Someone's hot for teacher!

440
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:02,565
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

441
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,988
I should go home.

442
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:06,740
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

443
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,324
Nina!

444
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:33,465
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

445
00:53:01,702 --> 00:53:02,245
Again.

446
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:36,556
Again.

447
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:50,131
Do you have any corrections?
